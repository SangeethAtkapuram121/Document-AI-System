# PDF to Excel Extractor

This Python script extracts text from a PDF file, processes it using a Hugging Face model, and saves the extracted details to an Excel sheet.

## Features

- Extracts text from PDF files using `pdfplumber`.
- Processes the text with a Hugging Face model (e.g., Donut) using the `transformers` library.
- Saves the processed results to an Excel file using `pandas`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pdfplumber`
- `transformers`
- `pandas`
- `openpyxl`

## Installation

You can install the required Python libraries using pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install pdfplumber transformers pandas openpyxl
```

## Usage

1. **Save the script** to a file named `pdf_to_excel.py`.

2. **Run the script** from the command line with the following syntax:

    ```bash
    python pdf_to_excel.py <path_to_input_pdf> <path_to_output_excel>
    ```

    Replace `<path_to_input_pdf>` with the path to the input PDF file and `<path_to_output_excel>` with the path where you want to save the output Excel file.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    python pdf_to_excel.py input.pdf output.xlsx
    ```
